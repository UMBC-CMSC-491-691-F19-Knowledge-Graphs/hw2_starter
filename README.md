# cmsc 491/691 fall 2019 hw2_starter 

Starter repository for HW2

You are asked to develop an XML representation for the UMBC course offerings. Review a sample of computer science courses from the UMBC Fall 2019 schedule for the data that is associated with courses. Specifically 

* design an appropriate XML representation and express it using an XML Schema (not a DTD)
* use your XML representation to encode the data for CMSC 435 and 471 from the Fall 2019 schedule
* develop a simple XSLT transformation to render this as HTML. 

You will find the material in the appendix of the Semantic Web Primer helpful. the directories cdcatalog and expenseReport contain simple examples of xml, xsd and xsl files.
